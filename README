HOTPLUGGING:
------------
Some scripts are generated during build:

* libmtp.usermap + libmtp.sh constitute an old hotplug script
  solution.
* libmtp.usermap constitute a modern udev solution.


Calendar support:
-----------------

The Creative Zen series can read VCALENDAR2 (.ics) files
from programs with the following limitations/conditions:

- The file must be in DOS (CR/LF) format, use the unix2dos
  program to convert if needed
- Repeat events do not seem to be supported, entries will
  only appear once.
- Files should be stored in the folder "My Organizer" when
  sent to the device (Use the option -f "My Organizer" to
  sendfile for this)
