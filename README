HOTPLUGGING:
------------
Some scripts are generated during build:

* libmtp.usermap + libmtp.sh constitute an old hotplug script
  solution.
* libmtp.usermap constitute a modern udev solution.


Calendar support:
-----------------

The Creative Zen series can read VCALENDAR2 (.ics) files
from programs with the following limitations/conditions:

- The file must be in DOS (CR/LF) format, use the unix2dos
  program to convert if needed
- Repeat events do not seem to be supported, entries will
  only appear once.
- Files should be stored in the folder "My Organizer" when
  sent to the device (Use the option -f "My Organizer" to
  sendfile for this)


libgphoto2 heritage:
--------------------

libmtp is based on libgphoto2, in practice this means we
use ptp.c, ptp.h and ptp-pack.c verbatim from the libgphoto2
source code. If you need to change things in these files,
make sure it is so general that libgphoto2 will want to
merge it to their codebase too.
