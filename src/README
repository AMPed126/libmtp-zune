Lots of docs to follow...

libptp2 is copied (and modified) from version 1.1.0.

For now, to get the endianness right for your system, try configure in libptp2.

I have changed the config script slightly for the le64atoh function in libptp-endian.h.
This is required for OS X on PowerPC (not sure why).  I've just cast the bytes to uint64_t
to avoid shifting wrongly.
