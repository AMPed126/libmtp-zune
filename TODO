TODO file:
----------

* Add logic to transfer very large files in chunks, like 1 MB at the
  time, or we cannot upload movies...

* Fix compiler warnings.

* Add audio/video playlist support.

* Make an API that can return several devices not just connect to the
  first one...

* Make the usb r/w stuff in libusb-glue.c take the device as parameter,
  then put the callback function in the device and make it call.
  (IMPOSSIBLE: the device is created after a lot of writing has already
   taken place, shall we use a dummy device holder then?)

* Add all thinkable codecs.

* Add a function that will list the available codecs for a certain device.
