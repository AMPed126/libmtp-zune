----------

* Support abstract MTP album (0xBA03) just like playlists. Too
  bad that Creative devices do not support them, they group the
  albums by using the metadata instead. Support representative
  sample (i.e. album cover).

* Support playback and volume setting on devices that have it.
  (I don't have one that does - Linus.)

* Make an API that can return several devices not just connect to the
  first one...
