libmtp was invented by:

Richard Low <richard@wentnet.com>
Linus Walleij <triad@df.lth.se>

We both came to do libmtp after working on the libnjb
project.

libmtp is however largely based on libptp2, which was created by
Mariusz Woloszyn <emsi@ipartners.pl>

We later started to use libgphoto2 which is also based on the same
code as libptp2 but with large contributions from
Marcus Meissner <marcus@jet.franken.de>
